# KnowledgeBase about CMake

this project collects some knowledge I gained abour CMake. It might be not all correct what I am writing here, but this is how I made the things working as I needed it. Feel free to fork this project and raise pull requests if you know something better. I would be happy about it. 

For every aspect of CMake I try to give an example. On this page I give a brief explanation what is solved in every example.
