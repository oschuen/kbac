# KnowledgeBase about CMake

this project collects some knowledge I gained about CMake. It might be not all correct what I am writing here, 
but this is how I made the things working for me. Feel free to fork this project and raise pull requests, 
if you know something better. I would be happy about it. 

For every aspect of CMake I try to give a simple example. On this page I give a brief explanation what is solved in every example.

__[Hello World](HelloWorld/README.md)__

Simple Example with a self contained Executable

__[Install a library](HelloLib/README.md)__

Shows how to install a static library for later use in other projects

__[Usa a library](LibUsage/README.md)__

Shows how to use the library created in the example before

__[Multi Project](MultiProject/README.md)__

Shows how multiple projects can be aggregated to one with sub-projects.
